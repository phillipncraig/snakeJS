# snakeJS
This is a working version of the classic Nokia 'Snake' game written in vanilla javascript! Use the arrow keys to change the snake direction, and pick up the apples to grow in length! This was a proof of concept for me to write more code in Vanilla JS (as opposed to React where I spend a lot of my time), the next steps would be to tidy up the UI, adding a score counter and options to play on variable speed settings.

# Usage:

```bash
> Clone repository 
> run index.html (via Chrome)
> play snake!
```
